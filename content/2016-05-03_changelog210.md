Summary: ![By Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Public domain)]({filename}/images/2016-05-05_changelog2100/ursus_americanus.jpg) So named after the magnificent king of the Taiga, the Black Bear, which the Native American Indians considered a symbol for the free spirit; surely one of the best and most steadfast guides one could hope for.

Many important things have happened on May 3rd: in 1965 satellite TV was used for the first time, In 1851 much of San Francisco was destroyed by Fire, or more apropos, in 1654 the Bridge at Rowley, Massachusetts began charging a toll for crossing animals.

So too, and equally important to us, May 3rd is the day that we at Taiga begin charging a (modest and fair - we hope) fee for our service. **It's our way of building a sustainable business to continue delivering a service that will increasingly delight and support your own work.** We look forward to having you as a happy, paying customers. Naturally, our free plans will remain in place.

There are a few goodies in this release:

###Added sprint title on search results for user stories
Projects are becoming more and more complicated to manage. Taiga aim is to make your management easy so from now, when searching and filtering User Stories, if a User Story is already included in a sprint, it will be visible on the search results.  Thanks to [@everblut](https://github.com/everblut)
