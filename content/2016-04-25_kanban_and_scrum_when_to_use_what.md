Summary: ![Matrix - Red pell scene ]({filename}/images/2016-04-25_kanban_and_scrum_when_to_use_what/matrix-red-pill.jpg) We’re always in pursuit of the best tool or technique or methodology that we think will almost magically set us on the path to be super productive, super fast and super cool people who can fix bugs in minutes if not seconds, who can estimate stuff correct upto two decimal places and who can foresee any possible upcoming roadblocks. But, till that happens, we’ll have to make use of the current tools and techniques.

So, how do you choose a methodology for your own use? If someone asked this a couple of years back, 99% of the respondents would have answered, *“I think scrum fits well for my project work and so we use Scrum”*. But things are changing now. There is another methodology coming up that allows for easy to use yet very efficient project management activities - Kanban. While both Kanban and Scrum are related to the Agile family, they are different in many ways. It is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses to correctly decide which of these is the right option for you. In this post, I will compare Kanban and Scrum on the basis of few core features and requirements in day to day activities. That will give you a clearer picture of what may suit your use case better.


## Planning

Scrum stresses on planning. From sprint planning to sprint retrospective - there are a lot of meetings meant to make sure the team is aligned about the next steps, priorities and learnings from previous sprints. While this may be useful for big teams with distributed teams who need to be in sync but small teams with few resources can do away with all these meetings and just align on what needs to be done next. For example consider this scenario - there is a new feature to be implemented, and the concerned teams spend half a day in the sprint planning meeting, discussing (and sometimes even debating) the scope and priority of the new tasks. It makes sense if it is a big project with several small teams collaborating on various interfaces, however if this is a small incremental addition to the project with few interfaces it is not worth to spend time on this. If at all there is a problem between teams the members can schedule one on one meetings to figure things out.


## Estimation

Scrum implicitly assumes that developers are perfect at estimations and it tries to drive productivity by imposing a time limit on work. You can think of sprint as a bucket of total available work hours that get filled up with tasks based on your estimations. But let's face it, all of us have failed at estimations, and sometimes very spectacularly. So, when the team commits to certain tasks based on just estimations, it may be probably as good as a wild guess. But, if you have been doing scrum for sometime and have a fair enough idea of the team velocity, things are different. You have a logical reason to believe that certain stuff can be done in certain time.

Kanban on the other hand has no mandatory requirements for commitment or even estimation. Developers get stuff assigned to them and they work on it till it finished or something very important comes up. So, if you have fair enough time and don’t mind getting few initial sprints wrong (in terms of estimations) and most importantly interested to understand your team velocity in order to get better task estimation later on - Scrum is the way to go. On the other hand, if you think getting tasks done is important at the cost of learning how fast the team is going, you can use Kanban and get on with it.


## Morale

One of the most important aspects of any project management methodology is team morale. If you take the example of scrum, you don’t want your developers to burn out doing stuff that they committed to at the beginning of a sprint. However, this is a very common scenario. As we discussed in the above point, humans are not good estimators and if someone over commits at the beginning of the sprint, it is sure that they will have to stretch during the sprint to cover the ground. If this continues for a few sprints, developers will be either completely burnt out or will willingly try to under commit - at the cost of project development. You can’t afford both of this. Since Kanban doesn’t have a time boxing constraint, there is no such issue if you implement Kanban.


## Charting

Scrum recommends collection of time measurements made during sprints and uses it to calculate the average time taken by the team to finish a task, called the team velocity. There is also the burndown chart that graphically depicts the user story points against time passed. These charts and data are meant to help you get a clearer idea of team’s current status and whether or not the deliverables will be ready on time. However, sometimes this data seems superfluous or not worth the effort required to feed all the necessary data points to your project management tool. Kanban can come in handy in such cases. Since Kanban doesn’t recommend any charts or graphs at all, there is no overhead to manage and track performance data.


## True agility?

As the sprint planning meeting finishes and developers commit to the tasks, an ideal scrum setup doesn’t allow any change in the task list at all. This is how scrum works, you can’t change the task list in between a sprint. This may have been a good plan if we lived in an ideal world, but things change in our world and that too very quickly. Your clients can suddenly ask you to drop a feature and work on something else or your own product roadmap can change based on customer feedback - in such cases Scrum doesn’t feel completely Agile, as it mandates commitment from both management and developers on the tasks to be finished. Kanban on the other hand can easily accommodate such scenarios.
