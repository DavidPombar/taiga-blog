Sheer envy led us to the name of this release; how much more could we be doing with eight arms instead of 2? Perhaps not much. We've been flat out, working on very significant updates to Taiga, the release of the upcoming and very cool Taiga Tribe and getting ready for the Taiga paid plans which we need to ensure we keep our lights on! *Here are some the highlights from this release:*

###Discover public projects
The Project Management platform we always imagined (and decided to build) not only needed to be a beautiful and intuitive "tool", it also had to be "place" where we could all congregate to learn and help each other out. Taiga is now used by teams large and small in almost every country in the world. Many of the projects are "public". Curious to see what they are all about?

Head over to the [Taiga.io home page](http://taiga.io) - you know, the one you haven't been to since you first signed up? We've added a searchable directory that allows you to find Public Projects, explore their backlogs, timelines, issues, teams, etc.

Check out the most liked or most active projects, check out our featured projects section, filter by kanban, scrum, or search for people and see what they're up to....You get it... Get social!

###Improved project profile
Now that people can see your project (if its public) dress it up. Add a nice logo image, a short, memorable description use tags that define your work. Do this even if your project is private, you still want to look good for the ones in the know.

###Find people to contribute in your project
If you are looking for people to contribute to your project, edit your project profile and tell the community what do you need. Share your project with the world and let other help.

###Drag and drop attachments from your desktop to Taiga
A better and improved attachments UI requires a better attachments management. Just drag and drop your attachments from the desktop into the attachments module or in the detail description to upload images. Fast!

###Improved Attachment Handling
Save time by dragging attachments from your desktop to the attachments section or into WYSIWYG areas. There is now an attachments image gallery in detail pages. Also mush easier light box-enabled attachment uploading to User Stories, Issues and Tasks.

###Assign to me button
Sometimes, if you want something done well, you just have to do it yourself. If that's the case with you, now when a Story, task or issue are unassigned, you can quickly assign it to yourself.
