Summary: ![Taiga Day](/images/2014-12-10_changelog140/01.jpg) We start off 2015 with the aptly named 1.5 Taiga release, Betula Pendula (which sounds very funny if you say it 5 times quickly.) Betula Pendula, more commonly known as the Silver Birch, has attributes that make it the perfect namesake for 1.5.0.

We start off 2015 with the aptly named 1.5 Taiga release, Betula Pendula (which sounds very funny if you say it 5 times quickly.) Betula Pendula, more commonly known as the Silver Birch, has attributes that make it the perfect namesake for 1.5.0.

Betula Pendula forged a path of expansion not dissimilar to our own; originating in Europe, and then extending eastwards to China, Siberia, Turkey, Iran and beyond, not long before being introduced into North America where it is considered an invader. Which begs the question, is Taiga.io an invader? It certainly feels that way sometimes with over 21,000 projects initiated on our platform by about as many users!

Our community is growing at a rate of about 100% month over month, and if our Twitter followers are anything to go by, this is precisely the highly talented and very discerning group of developers and designers we were hoping to conquer!

But enough about you….

We took our time getting this release out (you did know we had our weeklong [ΠWEEK](http://www.kaleidos.net/blog/category/%CF%80week/) hackathon, right?) but we couldn't be happier with what it brings to your doorstep:

#### New features

- **Slack integration**! Who isn't intrigued by the hockey stick growth of this fabulous chat app? We certainly are, and we know many on Taiga.io love it as well, so to us, putting them together is like Peanut Butter & Jelly, Bogart & Bacall, Gin & Tonic…. You get the picture.
- **Import/Export Projects** If you love something, set it free, right? So go on - move your projects in and out, from our hosted version to yours, or vice versa. Data wants to be free!
- **Webhooks** Use them to very easily integrate services you use that allow connection via webhooks. Be it a budget or accounting system, a hookup with your twitter, or lighting a bulb every time you solve an issue! Be sure to let us know what cool connections you concoct so we can share them with the community.
- **Streamlined Self-Hosted Installation** The front end is now fully compiled, making the overall installation process way easier and faster.

#### UI Improvements

- **Email redesign** We improved Taiga email look&feel so it's easier to read and, of course, with an eye on design.
- **Better loading pages and spinner** So you will always know when something is happening.
- **Archive User Stories** Now you can archive User Stories in kanban view so they are not visible by default and your team can focus on their project.
- **Hide closed milestones** As with User Stories, old sprints will always be visible, but they are hidden by default to focus on current work.

#### Misc

- **Improved browser compatibility** Taiga will look much better on naughty Internet Explorer and Safari.
- **Reduced number of API calls** We optimized and optimized and made the application leaner and meaner when it comes to API calls.
- **Speed Improvements** Both our front and back ends gain Tesla-like speed boosts due to reduction in API calls. In some back end functions we managed up to 90% speed improvements!

### Roadmap: Here's What's coming
#### Near term (next 30-45 days)
- **Custom Fields** You will be able to track any variable you need in Taiga by adding your own custom fields.
- **Redmine Importer** Hey Redminers, get some fresh and healthy air, you are welcome to Taiga.

#### Mid term: (by April)
We have a special surprise for the summer that we think will blow your mind! But we're keeping that to ourselves a while longer.

### Other Business & Very Important Announcement
We are delaying the introduction of paid plans. Initially we said they'd be coming in the Spring, but for those of you who want to pay (and there are few of you who've said as much- thank you!) we're keeping things as they are until summer. Remember that paid plans on Taiga.io are intended for those pèople who want to use our cloud version and keep their projects private. For all others, Taiga.io remains gloriously open source and free.

On a lesser note, our **Redmine importer tool** is getting awfully close to release. Anyone out there interested in testing the preview version, drop us a line at [support@taiga.io](support@taiga.io)
