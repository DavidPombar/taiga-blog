Summary: ![NPS / Jacob W. Frank: Denali National Park and Preserve]({filename}/images/2016-03-31_changelog200/pulsatilla_patens.jpg) To celebrate beautiful hairy things, we've name Taiga 2.0 the Pulsatilla Patens release, named after this beautiful purple, slightly hairy flower native to Europe, Russia, Mongolia, China, Canada and the United States. And why not? It's been hairy getting to 2.0, but it is indeed beautiful (code).

Whew! This is our 11th release in 18 months! The only people busier than we are are you **120,000 registered Taiga users who've initiated over 450,000 user stories**! Wow!

So 2.0 is chock full of stuff. With no further ado:

###Paid Plans
If there's anything we all love more than an 18 month free ride, it's being able to pay our bills. And so it is with Taiga! As an Open Source tool, we remain committed to offering our tool for free either as a self-install or for those of you who don't mind [sharing your projects publicly on Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/discover){target="_blank"}. You will also continue to have one private project as part of our free plan. But if you want privacy for 2 or more projects, the time has come to register for a payment plan. If this applies to you, **starting now and until April 30, 2016 you can (must) pre-register for one of paid plans** by going to your user settings.

Pre-Register for a paid plan now. You will not be charged until April 30th for your first month of service in May. If you have not pre-registered prior to April 30, your account will be inaccesible starting May 1st. Your data WILL NOT be erased. Feel free to contact us at [support@taiga.io](support@taiga.io) if you have any special needs, issuances of Purchase Orders, etc.

###Transfer Ownership
People come and go. Now, if needed, a project owner can transfer ownership to another member, or a user with admin privileges can request the current owner to transfer ownership to them.

###Ownership Badge
Who owns ya baby? To make sure all the members of a project know who has that privilege,  we've added a "badge" that identifies the project owner. Be aware that the project owner is the only one with the permissions to subscribe to a paid plan.p.

###Create URL custom fields
Sometimes is great to use a nice reference to an external link to complete the description of your User Story, Task or issue. Thanks to Δndrea Stagi ([@astagi](https://github.com/astagi){target="_blank"}) we have a new URL field type. Easy to add in your custom fields!

###Limit projects and memberships per user on self-hosted Taiga instances.
If you run your own Taiga instance, now you can limit the number of members any given project can have or the number of private or public projects a user can own.
